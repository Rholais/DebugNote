##	SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKS: BOTTOM-UP

###	Layer I: Infrastructure

An SDN infrastructure, similarly to a traditional network, is  
composed of a set of networking equipment (switches, routers  
and middlebox appliances). The main difference resides in the  
fact that those traditional physical devices are now simple  
forwarding elements without embedded control or software  
to take autonomous decisions. The network intelligence is  
removed from the data plane devices to a logically-centralized  
control system, i.e., the network operating system and applications,  
as shown in Figure 6 (c). More importantly,  
these new networks are built (conceptually) on top of open  
and standard interfaces (e.g., OpenFlow), a crucial approach  
for ensuring configuration and communication compatibility  
and interoperability among different data and control plane  
devices. In other words, these open interfaces enable controller  
entities to dynamically program heterogeneous forwarding  
devices, something difficult in traditional networks, due to  
the large variety of proprietary and closed interfaces and the  
distributed nature of the control plane.  

与传统网络相似， SDN 基础设施，是包括交换机，路由器和 middlebox 设备在内的一系列网络设备的集合。一个主要的区别在于，传统的物理设备仅仅简单地转发信息而没有嵌入式控制或者软件控制下的自主选择。网络智能被从数据层剥离到一个逻辑中心化的控制系统，如图6所示的网络操作系统与应用。更加重要的是，这些新型网络是建立在开放、标准的接口上（如 OpenFlow），这保证了不同数据层与控制层设备之间配置与通信的兼容性与互操作性。换句话说，这些开放的接口使得控制器实体动态地对多样化的转发设备进行编程提供可能。由于各种专利与封闭的接口以及控制层的分布式 nature ，这在传统网络中恰恰是非常困难的。

In an SDN/OpenFlow architecture, there are two main  
elements, the controllers and the forwarding devices, as shown  
in Figure 7. A data plane device is a hardware or software  
element specialized in packet forwarding, while a controller  
is a software stack (the “network brain”) running on a commodity  
hardware platform. An OpenFlow-enabled forwarding  
device is based on a pipeline of flow tables where each entry  
of a flow table has three parts: (1) a matching rule, (2)  
actions to be executed on matching packets, and (3) counters  
that keep statistics of matching packets. This high-level and  
simplified model derived from OpenFlow is currently the most  
widespread design of SDN data plane devices. Nevertheless,  
other specifications of SDN-enabled forwarding devices are  
being pursued, including POF [31], [120] and the Negotiable  
Datapath Models (NDMs) from the ONF Forwarding Abstractions  
Working Group (FAWG) [121].  

如图7，在 SDN/OpenFlow 架构中，控制器与转发设备是两个主要的组成部分。数据层设备是一种专注于包转发的硬件或软件，而控制器是在日常硬件平台上运行的一个软件栈（网络中枢）。支持 OpenFlow 的转发设备基于流表的管道。流表的每一个入口具有三个部分：(1) 匹配规则，(2) 对匹配包的操作，以及(3) 记录匹配包数据的计数器。由 OpenFlow 派生出来的这种高层与简化的模型被广泛用于 SDN 数据层设备设计。不过依然存在其他形式的支持 SDN 的转发设备，例如 POF [31], [120] 以及 ONF FAWG [121] 的 NDMs。

Inside an OpenFlow device, a path through a sequence of  
flow tables defines how packets should be handled. When a  
new packet arrives, the lookup process starts in the first table  
and ends either with a match in one of the tables of the pipeline  
or with a miss (when no rule is found for that packet). A flow  
rule can be defined by combining different matching fields, as  
illustrated in Figure 7. If there is no default rule, the packet  
will be discarded. However, the common case is to install  
a default rule which tells the switch to send the packet to  
the controller (or to the normal non-OpenFlow pipeline of the  
switch). The priority of the rules follows the natural sequence  
number of the tables and the row order in a flow table. Possible  
actions include (1) forward the packet to outgoing port(s), (2)  
encapsulate it and forward it to the controller, (3) drop it, (4)  
send it to the normal processing pipeline, (5) send it to the  
next flow table or to special tables, such as group or metering  
tables introduced in the latest OpenFlow protocol.    

在 OpenFlow 设备中，一系列流表规定了包的处理方式。当有新包到达时，一个查询过程将遍历流表寻找匹配的规则。如图7，这些规则涉及不同的匹配方式。如果没有缺省的规则，未匹配的包将被忽略。不过，普遍的处理方式是创建一个缺省规则以将未匹配的包发送到控制器或者交换机上的普通非 OpenFlow 管道。规则的优先级由流表的序列号和表中各规则的排列顺序确定。可能的处理规则包括：(1) 将包转发到出口，(2) 将其封装并发送给控制器，(3) 丢弃，(4) 发送到普通处理管道，(5) 发送给下一个流表或者特表例如最新的 OpenFlow 协议规定的组或者 metering 表。

As detailed in Table III, each version of the OpenFlow  
specification introduced new match fields including Ethernet,  
IPv4/v6, MPLS, TCP/UDP, etc. However, only a subset of  
those matching fields are mandatory to be compliant to a given  
protocol version. Similarly, many actions and port types are  
optional features. Flow match rules can be based on almost  
arbitrary combinations of bits of the different packet headers  
using bit masks for each field. Adding new matching fields  
has been eased with the extensibility capabilities introduced  
in OpenFlow version 1.2 through an OpenFlow Extensible  
Match (OXM) based on type-length-value (TLV) structures.  
To improve the overall protocol extensibility, with OpenFlow  
version 1.4 TLV structures have been also added to ports, tables,  
and queues in replacement of the hard-coded counterparts  
of earlier protocol versions.  

如表3所示，OpenFlow 的各版本引入了包括以太网， IPv4/v6，MPLS，TCP/UDP 等许多新的匹配方式。然而，只有一部分匹配方式被这些版本要求强制支持。相似地，许多行为与端口类型是可选特性。使用各自的位掩码，流匹配规则几乎可以基于何种包头中任意位的组合。基于 TLV 结构，OpenFlow v1.2 提供的 OXM 支持可扩展的匹配方式，这缓解了 OpenFlow 加入新的匹配方式的进程。为了提高协议的扩展能力，端口、流表、队列将早起版本中硬编码的匹配方式替换为 OpenFlow v1.4 TLV 结构。

*Overview of available OpenFlow devices*

Several OpenFlow-enabled forwarding devices are available  
on the market, both as commercial and open source products  
(see Table IV). There are many off-the-shelf, ready to deploy,  
OpenFlow switches and routers, among other appliances. Most  
of the switches available on the market have relatively small  
Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAMs), with up to  
8K entries. Nonetheless, this is changing at a fast pace. Some  
of the latest devices released in the market go far beyond  
that figure. Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) switches for common  
business purposes are already supporting up to 32K L2+L3 or  
64K L2/L3 exact match flows [122]. Enterprise class 10GbE  
switches are being delivered with more than 80K Layer 2 flow  
entries [123]. Other switching devices using high performance  
chips (e.g., EZchip NP-4) provide optimized TCAM memory  
that supports from 125K up to 1000K flow table entries [124].  
This is a clear sign that the size of the flow tables is growing at  
a pace aiming to meet the needs of future SDN deployments.  

由表3可见，市场上有多种或商用、或开源的支持 OpenFlow 的转发设备。在这些设备中，不少 OpenFlow 交换机与路由器现货供应，随时可以部署。市场上大多数的交换机具有可达 8K 的相对小的 TCAMs。然而，这种局面正在迅速改变。市场上最新的设备已经远远超出了这些参数。普通商用的 GbE 交换机已经支持了高达 32K L2+L3 或 64K L2/L3 的精确匹配流 [122]。企业级的 10GbE 交换机可以提供超过 80K L2 流入口 [123]。使用EZchip NP-4 等高性能芯片的其他交换机提供优化的 TCAM 支持 125K 到 1000K 的流表入口 [124]。这说明流表的大小将能满足未来的 SDN 部署需求。

Networking hardware manufacturers have produced various  
kinds of OpenFlow-enabled devices, as is shown in Table IV.  
These devices range from equipment for small businesses  
(e.g., GbE switches) to high-class data center equipment (e.g.,  
high-density switch chassis with up to 100GbE connectivity  
for edge-to-core applications, with tens of Tbps of switching  
capacity).  

由表4可见，网络硬件制造商已经生产了多种型号的支持 OpenFlow 的设备。这些设备覆盖了小公司需要的 GbE 交换机到高级数据中心部署高密度交换机架以及具有 100GbE 连通性与 10Tbps 级别交换容量的 edge-to-core 应用。

Software switches are emerging as one of the most promising  
solutions for data centers and virtualized network infrastructures  
[147], [148], [149]. Examples of software-based  
OpenFlow switch implementations include Switch Light [145],  
ofsoftswitch13 [141], Open vSwitch [142], OpenFlow Reference  
[143], Pica8 [150], Pantou [146], and XorPlus [46].  
Recent reports show that the number of virtual access ports is  
already larger than physical access ports on data centers [149].  
Network virtualization has been one of the drivers behind this  
trend. Software switches such as Open vSwitch have been  
used for moving network functions to the edge (with the core  
performing traditional IP forwarding), thus enabling network  
virtualization [112].  

软件交换机是一种非常有潜力的数据中心与网络基础设施虚拟化解决方案 [147], [148], [149]。它的实现包括 Switch Light [145], ofsoftswitch13 [141], Open vSwitch [142], OpenFlow Reference [143], Pica8 [150] 以及 XorPlus [46]. 近期有报告显示，数据中心中虚拟接入端口的数量已经超过物理接入端口 [149]。网络虚拟化是这种趋势的幕后推手之一。以 Open vSwitch 为例的软交换机将传统 IP 传发中处于中心位置的功能移动到边缘，使得网络虚拟化成为可能 [112]。

An interesting observation is the number of small, startup  
enterprises devoted to SDN, such as Big Switch, Pica8,  
Cyan, Plexxi, and NoviFlow. This seems to imply that SDN is  
springing a more competitive and open networking market, one  
of its original goals. Other effects of this openness triggered by  
SDN include the emergence of so-called “bare metal switches”  
or “whitebox switches”, where the software and hardware are  
sold separately and the end-user is free to load an operating  
system of its choice [151].  

一个有趣的现象是，有一批小的创业公司投身于 SDN 之中，例如 Big Switch, Pica8, Cyan, Plexxi 与 NoviFlow. 看起来 SDN 正在如愿成为一个充满竞争的开放网络市场。由 SDN 触发的这种开放导致的另一个结果是 "bare metal switches" 或 "whitebox switch" 的出现。他们使得软件与硬件可以分开出售，终端用户可以自由配置加载的操作系统。

###	Layer II: Southbound Interfaces

Southbound interfaces (or southbound APIs) are the connecting  
bridges between control and forwarding elements, thus  
being the crucial instrument for clearly separating control and  
data plane functionality. However, these APIs are still tightly  
tied to the forwarding elements of the underlying physical or  
virtual infrastructure.  

南向接口（或者叫南向API）是控制部件与转发部件之间的联系，是将控制层与数据层的功能分开的重要器件。然而，这些 API 对底层的物理与虚拟设施具有深度的依赖。

Typically, a new switch can take two years to be ready for  
commercialization if built from scratch, with upgrade cycles  
that can take up to nine months. The software development for  
a new product can take from six months to one year [152]. The  
initial investment is high and risky. As a central component  
of its design the southbound APIs represent one of the  
major barriers for the introduction and acceptance of any new  
networking technology. In this light, the emergence of SDN  
southbound API proposals such as OpenFlow [9] is seen as  
welcome by many in the industry. These standards promote  
interoperability, allowing the deployment of vendor-agnostic  
network devices. This has already been demonstrated by the  
interoperability between OpenFlow-enabled equipments from  
different vendors.  

一般一个新的交换机从草稿到商业化需要两年时间，如果仅仅是升级的话仅需要九个月，新产品的软件开发需要6个月到1年 [152]，早期投资高、风险大。作为设计中的中心部件，南向 API 是新技术在被引入和接受过程中的一个主要瓶颈。由此，以 OpenFlow [9] 为例的SDN 南向 API 方案的出现得到了工业界的欢迎。这些标准增强了网络互通性，允许了未知厂商网络设备的部署。不同厂商 OpenFlow 兼容设备间的恰恰说明了这一点。

As of this writing, OpenFlow is the most widely accepted  
and deployed open southbound standard for SDN. It provides  
a common specification to implement OpenFlow-enabled forwarding  
devices, and for the communication channel between  
data and control plane devices (e.g., switches and controllers).  
The OpenFlow protocol provides three information sources for  
network operating systems. First, event-based messages are  
sent by forwarding devices to the controller when a link or  
port change is triggered. Second, flow statistics are generated  
by the forwarding devices and collected by the controller.  
Third, packet-in messages are sent by forwarding devices to  
the controller when they do not known what to do with a  
new incoming flow or because there is an explicit “send to  
controller” action in the matched entry of the flow table. These  
information channels are the essential means to provide flowlevel  
information to the network operating system.  

OpenFlow 是当前使用与部署最广泛的 SDN 南向接口。它为支持 OpenFlow 的设备提供了共同的规范，实现了数据层设备（交换机）与控制层设备（控制器）之间的信道。OpenFlow 为网络操作系统提供了三种信源：(1) 当链接或端口改变时，转发设备会触发基于消息的事件的发送，(2) 流统计由转发设备生成并由控制器采集，(3) 当转发设备不知如何处理新流，或流表的匹配入口为“发送到服务器”动作时，将向控制器发送入包消息。这鞋信道是向网络操作系统提供流层信息的必要手段。

Albeit the most visible, OpenFlow is not the only available  
southbound interface for SDN. There are other API  
proposals such as ForCES [30], OVSDB [153], POF [31],  
[120], OpFlex [154], OpenState [155], Revised Open-  
Flow Library (ROFL) [156], Hardware Abstraction Layer  
(HAL) [157], [158], and Programmable Abstraction of Datapath  
(PAD) [159]. ForCES proposes a more flexible approach  
to traditional network management without changing the current  
architecture of the network, i.e., without the need of a  
logically-centralized external controller. The control and data  
planes are separated but can potentially be kept in the same  
network element. However, the control part of the network  
element can be upgraded on-the-fly with third-party firmware.  

OpenFlow 是最出名的但是不是唯一的 SDN 南向接口。其他推荐的 API 包括 ForCES [30], OVSDB [153], POF [31], [120], OpFlex [154], Openstate [155], ROFL [156], HAL [157], [158], PAD [159]. ForCES 提供了与传统网络管理间更宽松的连接，不需要改变当前网络架构，包括，不需要一个逻辑中心化的控制器：控制层与数据层是分离的，但是也可以放在同一个网络设备中。在第三方固件的支持下，网络设备的控制部分可以实现热升级。

OVSDB [153] is another type of southbound API, designed  
to provide advanced management capabilities for Open  
vSwitches. Beyond OpenFlow’s capabilities to configure the  
behavior of flows in a forwarding device, an Open vSwitch  
offers other networking functions. For instance, it allows the  
control elements to create multiple virtual switch instances, set  
QoS policies on interfaces, attach interfaces to the switches,  
configure tunnel interfaces on OpenFlow data paths, manage  
queues, and collect statistics. Therefore, the OVSDB is a  
complementary protocol to OpenFlow for Open vSwitch.  

OVSDB [153] 是另一种南向 API, 为 Open vSwitch 提供高级管理兼容。除了 OpenFlow 兼容的转发设备流表的行为配置，Open vSwitch 提供了更多的网络函数。例如，它允许控制设备创建多个虚拟交换机实例，为接口设计 QoS 方案，将接口连接到交换机，为 OpenFlow 流路径配置管道接口，管理队列，收集数据，等。因此，OVSDB 是 Open vSwitch 的 OpenFlow 补充协议。

One of the first direct competitors of OpenFlow is POF [31],  
[120]. One of the main goals of POF is to enhance the current  
SDN forwarding plane. With OpenFlow, switches have to  
understand the protocol headers to extract the required bits to  
be matched with the flow tables entries. This parsing represents  
a significant burden for data plane devices, in particular if we  
consider that OpenFlow version 1.3 already contains more than  
40 header fields. Besides this inherent complexity, backward  
compatibility issues may arise every time new header fields  
are included in or removed from the protocol. To achieve its  
goal, POF proposes a generic flow instruction set (FIS) that  
makes the forwarding plane protocol-oblivious. A forwarding  
element does not need to know, by itself, anything about the  
packet format in advance. Forwarding devices are seen as  
white boxes with only processing and forwarding capabilities.  
In POF, packet parsing is a controller task that results in a  
sequence of generic keys and table lookup instructions that  
are installed in the forwarding elements. The behavior of data  
plane devices is therefore completely under the control of the  
SDN controller. Similar to a CPU in a computer system, a  
POF switch is application- and protocol-agnostic.  

OpenFlow 的直接竞争者之一是 POF [31], [120]. POF 的主要目的之一是强化 SDN 现有的转发层。使用 OpenFlow 时，交换机必须能够解析包头以解析匹配流表项需要的位。
