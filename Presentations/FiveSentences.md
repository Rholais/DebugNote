Five Sentences
==============

Punctuation marks are essential when you are writing. They show the reader where sentences start and finish and if they are used properly they make your writing easy to understand. This section gives practical guidance on how to use semicolons, dashes, and other types of punctuation correctly, which always confused me, to make your writing always be clear and effective.



Semicolon 
---------

SOMERSET MAUGHAM — Of Human Bondage]*
